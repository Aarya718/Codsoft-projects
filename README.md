Projects Overview
This repository contains three machine learning projects that explore different domains of predictive analytics. Each project applies different algorithms and techniques to solve unique problems. The projects are:

Movies Rating Prediction
Sales Prediction
Credit Card Fraud Prediction
1. Movies Rating Prediction

Overview:
This project uses machine learning to predict the ratings of movies based on user preferences, genre, and other factors. The goal is to help recommend movies to users based on their predicted ratings for unseen movies.

Key Features:
Dataset: Movie ratings from users, including movie features (genre, director, etc.).

Algorithm: Collaborative filtering or regression-based techniques (like Decision Trees or Random Forest).

Objective: Predict ratings of movies that users haven’t watched yet.

Evaluation: Use of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for performance evaluation.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data processing
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization

How to Run:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Aarya718/Codsoft-projects.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script for rating prediction: python movie_rating_prediction.py
Check the evaluation results for accuracy.

2. Sales Prediction

Overview:
This project aims to predict future sales based on historical sales data, advertising budgets, and seasonal factors. It can help businesses forecast sales and make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies.

Key Features:
Dataset: Sales data with features such as previous sales, advertising budgets (TV, radio, newspaper), and time-based trends.

Algorithm: Regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.

Objective: Predict sales for the next period based on past sales and other influencing factors.

Evaluation: Use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score to evaluate the prediction accuracy.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for building regression models
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing sales trends

How to Run:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Aarya718/Codsoft-projects.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the sales prediction model: python sales_prediction.py
View the results of predicted sales and the evaluation metrics.

3. Credit Card Fraud Prediction

Overview:
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions from credit card transaction data. The goal is to classify whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on historical data.

Key Features:
Dataset: Credit card transaction data with features like transaction amount, merchant, and transaction history.

Algorithm: Classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

Objective: Predict fraudulent transactions based on previous transaction patterns.

Evaluation: Use of metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with a focus on minimizing false positives.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data handling
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing fraud detection results

How to Run:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Aarya718/Codsoft-projects.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the fraud prediction model: python credit_card_fraud_prediction.py
Check the performance metrics and analyze the fraud prediction results.
Installation & Setup
To run any of the projects, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Aarya718/Codsoft-projects.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Codsoft-projects
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project script for the relevant task (e.g., movie_rating_prediction.py, sales_prediction.py, or credit_card_fraud_prediction.py).

Usage
Movies Rating Prediction: This model can be used for recommending movies based on predicted ratings.

Sales Prediction: Helps in predicting sales for the next period based on historical data and other factors.

Credit Card Fraud Prediction: Detects fraudulent credit card transactions, which can be used by banks or financial institutions.
